        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        I am a graduate from Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Dhaka and currently doing Masters in the same department. My undergraduate thesis topic was on Quantum Dot Cellular Automata. I am a goal-oriented, meticulous, hardworking, empathetic, ambitious, resilient and honest person. I like to move forward with a novel purpose and integrity. As a social introvert, I prefer liveliness and freedom in what I am doing. Lack of freedom quickly drains my energy. I am a little bit perfectionist. I am interested to learn new things everyday and can grab new concepts and ideas quickly. I am a critical thinker and can generate great ideas if given the proper opportunity to do so.
